mkdir <dir name>
create virtual:
	 python3.6 -m venv --without-pip virtual

install pip from https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/:
	wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
now install django with pip, pip3, pip3.6 - to know which pip works;
or just pip/3/3.6 -V = the one in virtual is the one that works.


for portfolio am using pip3.
